## Exercise 2: Pretexting Attack (Social Engineering)

### Exercise 2: Pretexting Attack

### Objective
To analyze how attackers use fake identities to obtain confidential information.

### Description
Pretexting involves creating a believable story to gain a victim’s trust.

### Simulated Scenario
An attacker calls an employee pretending to be a new IT technician and requests login details.

Example dialogue (simulation only):
Attacker: Hi, this is Alex from IT. We are fixing a system issue.  
Victim: Okay.  
Attacker: Can you confirm your username?

### Attack Flow
1. Attacker researches the target  
2. Creates a fake role  
3. Gains trust  
4. Extracts information  

### Impact
- Information leakage  
- Account compromise 
- Unauthorized access

### Prevention
- Verify identity  
- Follow security procedures  
- Never share passwords

### Conclusion
Pretexting attacks exploit human trust rather than technical weaknesses
