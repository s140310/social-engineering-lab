## Exercise 1: Phishing Attack (Email-Based Social Engineering)

### Objective
To understand how phishing emails manipulate users into revealing sensitive information.

### Description
Phishing is a social engineering technique where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations to trick victims into clicking malicious links or providing credentials.

### Simulated Scenario
An attacker sends an email pretending to be from IT Support, warning the user that their account will be locked unless verified.

Example email (simulation only):

Subject: Urgent – Account Verification Required  
Dear User,  
We detected unusual activity in your account.  
Please verify within 24 hours to avoid suspension.

### Attack Flow
1. Attacker sends spoofed email  
2. Victim trusts the message  
3. Victim clicks the link  
4. Credentials are stolen  

### Impact
- Credential theft  
- Unauthorized access  

### Prevention
- Security awareness training  
- Avoid unknown links  
- Enable multi-factor authentication
